        <h1>Time Zone in India (GMT+5:30)</h1>

        <span>India has only one time zone. The country has officially observed India Standard Time (IST) since 1947. However, the UTC+5:30 offset has been used as the local standard time in India since 1906.

        India is a large country that stretches almost 3.000 kilometers (1.864 miles) from west to east. It spans nearly 30 degrees longitude (68°7'E to 97°25'E). If the country were to base its time zones on mean solar time, it would have three time zones, but since it only has one, the Sun rises almost two hours earlier in Guar Mota in the east than in Dong in the far west.</span>
